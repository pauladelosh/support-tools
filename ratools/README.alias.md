Alias file

The idea is to make more efficient the process of moving through the steps on the RA Dash VCS Page. These alias are made to enhance the beta_functions, not replace. We should be on the lookout for duplication.
The assumption is that each client update will get a new tab (âŒ˜T). Set all the variables shown in the "vars" command, then use the alias' that correspond to the RA Dash page, which has plans to be updated to reduce memory overload.

The variables stay within that tab, and each tab is named for easy ID.

Comments to the alpha_alias file have been added to make it easier to understand.

A work-in-progress.
